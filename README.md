# Program-neural-networks-with-TensorFlow
Join me in the journey in learning about Google TensorFlow course 

You can do it too from 
https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/tensorflow#codelab -https://developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-2-computervision

Please download the following Python liberaries 
-numpy
-tenserflow
-opencv

Download them using Command Prompt

All the files in my project are stored locally rather Google's Colab

The answers for the questions are 

1. When using model.predict, you may get an answer close to, but not exactly what you expect. You can attribute that to neural networks generally dealing in *probability* 

2. Match the following parameters and layers with their respective descriptions.
Each answer only matches one item.

Sequential - Defines the order of layers within a NN

Flatten - Turns multidimentional vector into a one dimensional vector
 	
Dense - Adds a desely connected layer of neurons

Activation function - Tells a layer of neurons what to do

ReLU - If X>0 returns X, else 0
 	
Softmax - Takes a set of values and helps you pick the....

3. *Image Compression* reduces the overall amount of information in an image while maintaining the detected features as present.

4. Overfitting occurs as a result of a neural network trained with ___ .

- Limited Data
